# odin-landing-page-birds
This repository is made to create a basic landing page to practice css and html

## header
the header has a mix with the background of the hero div, also, because the free logo, was difficult to match with the color of the img with the logo color, but with the bottons, using styles like bubbles, I could fix that problem an also add basic animations.

## hero
with the same background as the header, there is a black box that has all the content, just to differentiate the color of the background and the content.

## img gallery
this img gallery has the objetive to show birds to everyone that has the interest on learning more about nature, also this images are interactive, this because they have animations.

## legend
It's just a legend, nothing more

## footer
this was added to create a bottom of "Contact us", which could be used to connect to a email sender
